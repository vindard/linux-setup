## My Linux Quick Setup

This script is a quick setup script that I have been using to install various tools and services to my Linux-based environments. Linux installs can be varied and involved, so I've found this to be a useful resource to keep track of what things I've installed in different places and what steps I took to install them.

It started as a Github Gist ([see here](https://gist.github.com/vindard/d63e390c1f038f9a171d3ed85ae4d4d8)), but it's gotten a bit too big for that now so I felt it would be better off continuing as a properly version controlled Github repo.
### Usage

My current method for using this is to write an appropriate install function and then call it to the bottom of the script.
